# Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis

In this project, I have designed and trained a model to take natural language captions in english and generate images relevant to the image captions. 

I have used skip-thoughts to encode the input caption before feeding to the generator and to the discriminator.  

The method used is inspired by [Generative Adversarial Text to Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05396).

## Sample output
Included below are a few samples from our experiments:

Input caption | Generated image
------------ | -------------
**these flowers have an open face with many pale pink petals.** | ![Image 1](Output_Satisf/19_3700_60_Gen.jpg)
**this flower is red in color, and has petals that are closely wrapped around the center.** | ![Image 1](Output_Satisf/23_3700_60_Gen.jpg)
**this is a very cool flower with very bold white on the petals and a very unique middle.** | ![Image 1](Output_Satisf/17_3700_60_Gen.jpg)
**multiple layers of reddish-yellow petals that decrease in size as the are closer to the top of the flower.** | ![Image 1](Output_Satisf/7_3700_60_Gen.jpg)
**petals are light purple in color with longer stamens and a prominent green pistil.** | ![Image 1](Output_Satisf/12_3700_60_Gen.jpg)
